Scalable Cloud Programming (PGDCLOUD_SEP) 2022


M.Sc. / PG Cloud 
Scalable Cloud Programming Project 
  
The goal of the assignment is to demonstrate that you are able to critically analyse architectures and develop applications for the public cloud.   
  
Description   
Create a cloud application solution which integrates and consumes web application services. The solution is formed from   
• A client application which must allow user input.  The application has to be composed of/consume at least 2 different web services: 
    • One web service must be the one written by you 
    • At least one web service must be a publicly available web service 
  
• A services application, the services application functionality must be accessible via a set of APIs (e.g. RESTful API, SOAP). The service application APIs should provide the next workflow: 
    • Data is retrieved from an object store and transmitted back to the client   
    • The services must use a queue   
    • The client must process the data received, and then submit back to the services application the updated data   
    • Authentication/authorization is required   
  
• The services application must be hosted on a public cloud platform 
• Any programming language can be used for coding 
  
Tasks   
    • Describe the functional and non-functional requirements of the application  
    • Critically analyse and document the architecture of your application for the integration and composition of cloud application services   
    • Ensure that your application take advantage of suitable cloud development patterns   
    • Implement the application   
    • Test the application   
    • Deploy the application to an appropriate public cloud platform   
  
Deliverables   
Project Submission Deadline: Please check Moodle  
You must submit the following deliverables via Moodle:   
    • Documented source code of the application   
    • Technical report. It should be organised into the following sections:  
        ◦ Introduction  
        ◦ Background research/literature survey into the “data storage infrastructures in the cloud”. This section should be between 1000-1500 words.  
        ◦ Describe the functional and non-functional requirements of the application  
        ◦ Critically analse and document the architecture of your application for the integration and composition of cloud application services  
        ◦ Describe how your application takes advantage of suitable integration patterns  
        ◦ Findings during the design, development and implementation of the application  
        ◦ Testing of the application  
        ◦ Deployment of the application to an appropriate public cloud platform; include the URL of the cloud deployed solution   
        ◦ Conclusions  
        ◦ Don’t forget to include your references!!!
